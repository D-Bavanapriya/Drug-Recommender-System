# Drug-Recommender-System
# Overview
The Drug Recommender System is an intelligent solution designed to recommend drugs based on a patient's symptoms and medical history. Utilizing a combination of machine learning algorithms and healthcare data, the system provides personalized drug recommendations to enhance patient care.

# Features
Symptom-based Recommendations: Recommends drugs by analyzing user symptoms.
Data-Driven: Leverages a dataset to predict the most effective drugs for users.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for medical practitioners to input patient information.
Machine Learning Integration: Employs advanced algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.

# Dataset
The project uses a healthcare dataset that includes drug names, symptoms, and medical histories to train the model. The dataset helps in building models that provide personalized drug recommendations.


# Installation
To set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/D-Bavanapriya/Drug-Recommender-System.git

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the project:
python app.py

# Usage
* Input patient symptoms and medical history into the system.
* The system will process the inputs and return drug recommendations.
